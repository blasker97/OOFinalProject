# **Multithreading**

## **Swift**

Swift contains thread like abilities similar to many other languages.  The goal for Apple in their development of Swift was to make sure that applications can have multiple paths of execution that can run at the same time as the main thread.  The benefits of multithreading is it can improve an applications perceived response time and can also can benefit the application's real time performance.

#### **Multitasking and Concurrency**

Multitasking and concurrency can be essential to a well run application but it comes with its positives and negatives. Having multitasking occuring in your application allows for more functionality to be avaliable to the user at a touch of a button.  The downside of implementing this feature is syncronization has be to exact and perfect or a concurrent program will not function correctly at all.  The way Swift implements these features is through the old objective - C
